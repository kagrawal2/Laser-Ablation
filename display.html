    <h1 class="center">The Problem</h1>
    <p class="problem"><b>Space.</b> The vast infinity of untapped potential and resources. Asteroids are natural banks of materials which can be used to push space exploration to the next level. These asteroids carry valuable materials such as iron and nickel as well as ice, all of which can be utilized in building future space structures as well as providing sustenance for people. It is estimated that these asteroids hold billions to trillions of dollars in value. The tricky part is that asteroids are also huge abnormally shaped space rocks traveling at high speeds which means that extracting the resources from one is extremely difficult.</p>

    <p class="concept">Using high powered lasers, we propose a comprehensive system to mine space asteroids. This plan involves the DE-STAR, a large satellite orbiting earth housed with a phased locked array which is capable of producing multiple highly concentrated and power lasers. The DE-STAR can target a variety of different asteroids and through the use of spectroscopy, which will analyze the reflected laser light, the composition of an asteroid is determined.This lets us find which asteroid to target. </p>

    <p>The DE-STARLITE is a smaller satellite equipped with a high power laser capable of flying up to an asteroid and changing its trajectory buy superheating a location on the asteroid. This causes the asteroid to eject mass causing a force and torque, slowing down and stabilizing the asteroid. Using this method, the DE-STARLITE can adjust the velocity and direction of an asteroid, bringing it in earths orbit at a stable configuration. In doing so, we have brought the asteroid in close to earth and now it is ready for safe mining.

                <p class="right">
                  DE-STARLITE's main tool its its high power laser, which consists of a modular phase locked array, which can heat up asteroids to up to 3000K. This is all powered by two large photovoltaic solar panels 15 meters in diameter, which is attached to the satellite which provide 100 kWatts of power to the laser. To get to its location, the de-starlite uses ion engines as propulsion, which fire small ions at high velocity to change the momentum of the spacecraft. There are smaller ion engines on the sides which allow for maneuvering to approach the asteroid and adjust its positioning.

                <p class="right">
                Creating such a powerful laser is easier said than done, but current technology of high density power fibers brings us to the level of power necessary to create a laser required in the DE-STAR satellites. The DE_STAR which has an array of these lasers, controls the phase of each element to create a concentrated combined beam. The existing ytterbium fiber amplifier creates a power density around 0.2kW/kg, and great improvement is on the way. Both the DE-STAR and DE-STARLITE use the same phased locked system, but the DE-STAR has a much more powerful system.

            <h3>Determining the Composition</h3>
              <p class="right">
              Using the DE-STARLITE satellite we can also determine the composition of the asteroid. The laser can only needs to heat up the asteroid to up to 2500 kelvin, which when causes vaporization of the materials on the asteroid which are released in a plume. This creates a strong source of blackbody radiation. The reflected light from the laser is then measured which is affected by the cloud of ejected material, is then used to determine the materials on the asteroid.

            <h3>Positioning the Asteroid for Mining</h3>
              <p class="right"> 
              Getting the asteroid in a position to safely mine is quite difficult, but with the DE-STARLITE it can be done. The unit, which is already flying alongside the asteroid with its ion propulsion engines, calculates the rotational inertia of the asteroid. It then fires its laser at the correct location on the asteroid which allows for a mass ejection from the asteroid that despins the asteroid. This method is capable of despinning asteroids the size of Apophis (325 m diameter), allowing for not only the deflection of asteroids, but also the despinning and slowing of them for later mining. The DE-STATLITE calculates the necessary power output to place the asteroid in an orbit around earth as well as stabilizing its rotation. <p/><p>
              The DE-STATLITE follows the asteroid, guiding it to a safe orbit around earth, and now it is all ready for mining. Prospectors and space companies can now safely approach the asteroid which is now within close reach in space. Furthermore, there is no rush or time constraints on mining the asteroid which greatly opens up the methods and systems that are used, with the added benefit that these materials could be brought down to earth for use as well.

      <h1 class="center">Solution Validation</h1>

      <p class="right">
        While others have focused on our method of directed-energy ablation as a means of avoiding collisions, there is additional potential not only to achieve more efficient deflection but also to manipulate and utilize non-threatening asteroids for multiple beneficial purposes.
        Asteroids contain a wealth of materials useful for construction, obtainable without ravaging our planet and destroying its ecosystems. M-type asteroids contain very large quantities of refinery-grade nickel and iron, perfect for use on Earth or even for in-space construction. There is potential to use asteroids to build large vehicles directly in space, or even to hollow out and use an asteroid itself. Manipulation of near Earth asteroids is a key component of the NASA roadmap for space technology development.
         
        DE-STAR was created as a defense against incoming asteroid threats. However it has the capability not only to deflect, but also to precisely guide asteroids. DE-STAR can manipulate asteroids to be convenient for landing, or safely bring them near Earth to be mined, studied, even built upon. However, this process would be extremely difficult if the asteroid were spinning at high speed, so it is beneficial to first arrest its rotational motion. 

        We developed a setup involving extremely low friction, realistic rotation, and a vacuum chamber to simulate space conditions. Jewel bearings ensured minimal kinetic friction in our setup; but to properly simulate an asteroid rotating in two dimensions, static friction had to be overcome so that the asteroid would be in motion before ablation. To do this, we made an attachment to the spindle containing rare Earth magnets offset from the center of rotation, and a large secondary magnet that was dragged across the front of the chamber, forcing the attachment to move.

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p id="p1">To measure the speed of rotation we used a method involving laser tracking. As the asteroid assembly rotated in the vacuum, a secondary laser reflected off of two mirrors mounted on either side of the spindle. The reflected laser beam swept across a laser centroid detector, which then measured the rotation rate.
